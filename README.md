# Simon Says

An electronic memory game made using Arduino


It is an electronic memory game. You need to remember the sequence in which the LEDs will blink and then you need to push the buttons in the same sequence. The sequence will progressively increase as you keep clearing each level. The game will get over once you push a wrong button different from that in the sequence.

Example: If LEDs blink in order -> Red->Green(Remember the sequence), then you need to press the buttons in the same order to reach the next level.
